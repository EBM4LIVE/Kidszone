        <h1> Library with Books & Learning Materials.</h1><br/>
          <p>Libraries for children are essential preschool facilities for information and development. Either a library room or a small space that the children can use independently to browse books. In preschool, the library should be a kid-friendly place where children can go to read books, this facility helps to develop their READING HABITS since young.
            The library room or space should be an ORGANIZED and DEFINED SPACE for children to sit and read.
            There are some comfy elements you can add to the space such as lamps, curtains, chairs, beanbags and etc. Design a comfortable area for reading, can make your students more likely to spend time in the library.
            The kid’s library plays an important role in creating a better quality of early childhood learning experience that help improve children’s language and vocabulary development.</p>

            Creative area 
          </h1>
          <p>
            There are so many ways for children to explore and be creative. The creative area in a preschool classroom is a place where your little children can go creatively in drawing, expressing and playing.
            It doesn’t have to be a specific drawing area or learning area, but it’s a place for the children to HAVE FUN and LEARN at the same time. It’s a place where they can choose to do what they love, it helps develop their interest too
            Give the children plenty of time, materials and space for play. Children love to be spontaneous in their creative activities. Prepare a creative area to show the children that there are lots of activities they can do in one room.
            For example,  prepare the materials that can be homemade, recycled and natural materials including colourings pencils, clay, leaves, newspaper to stimulate play and imagination. So the children can choose to draw a person, do crafting by using recycled materials, build a house by using clay and etc. This lets children know they can develop their own idea.

          <h1>Open space classrooms 
          </h1>
          <p>
            Open space classroom is a trendy concept of the 21st-century school environment including preschool. A traditional classroom design with the teacher speaking in a fixed position at the front of the class is boring and dull. Asking little children to sit in their fixed position and listen to the teacher for a long time is like a mission impossible.
            That’s why an open space classroom offers students to have a great deal of FREEDOM in the classroom while learning. Open-plan environments are believed to be less authoritarian and achieve better children’s social development. It’s a concept that promotes the sharing of skills amongst teachers and students.
